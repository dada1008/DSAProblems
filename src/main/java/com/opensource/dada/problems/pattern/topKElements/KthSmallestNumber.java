/**
 * Problem:
 *
 * Given an unsorted array of numbers, find Kth smallest number in it.
 *
 * Please note that it is the Kth smallest number in the sorted order, not the Kth distinct element.
 *
 * Note: For a detailed discussion about different approaches to solve this problem,
 * take a look at Kth Smallest Number.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: [1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5], K = 3
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The 3rd smallest number is '5', as the first two smaller numbers are [1, 2].
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: [1, 5, 12, 2, 11, 5], K = 4
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The 4th smallest number is '5', as the first three small numbers are [1, 2, 5].
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: [5, 12, 11, -1, 12], K = 3
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: The 3rd smallest number is '11', as the first two small numbers are [5, -1].

     * Solution:
     *
     * We can use the Median of Medians algorithm to choose a good pivot for
     * the partitioning algorithm of the Quicksort.
     * This algorithm finds an approximate median of an array in linear time O(N)O(N).
     * When this approximate median is used as the pivot,
     * the worst-case complexity of the partitioning procedure reduces to linear O(N)O(N),
     * which is also the asymptotically optimal worst-case complexity of any sorting/selection algorithm.
     * This algorithm was originally developed by Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest,
     * and Tarjan and was describe in their 1973 paper.
     *
     * This is how the partitioning algorithm works:
     *
     * If we have 5 or less than 5 elements in the input array, we simply take its first element as the pivot.
     * If not then we divide the input array into subarrays of five elements
     * (for simplicity we can ignore any subarray having less than five elements).
     * Sort each subarray to determine its median. Sorting a small and
     * fixed numbered array takes constant time. At the end of this step,
     * we have an array containing medians of all the subarray.
     * Recursively call the partitioning algorithm on the array containing medians until we get our pivot.
     * Every time the partition procedure needs to find a pivot, it will follow the above three steps.
