XOR is a logical bitwise operator that returns 0 (false) if both bits are the same and returns 1 (true) otherwise. In other words, it only returns 1 if exactly one bit is set to 1 out of the two bits in comparison.

A	B	A xor B
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
It is surprising to know the approaches that the XOR operator enables us to solve certain problems.

Important properties of XOR to remember #
Following are some important properties of XOR to remember:

1. Taking XOR of a number with itself returns 0, e.g.,
    1 ^ 1 = 0
    29 ^ 29 = 0

2. Taking XOR of a number with 0 returns the same number, e.g.,
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    31 ^ 0 = 31

3. XOR is Associative & Commutative, which means:
    (a ^ b) ^ c = a ^ (b ^ c)
    a ^ b = b ^ a
