     * Solution #
     * This problem follows the Top ‘K’ Numbers pattern.
     * The biggest difference in this problem is that we need to find the closest (to ‘X’)
     * numbers compared to finding the overall largest numbers.
     * Another difference is that the given array is sorted.
     *
     * Utilizing a similar approach, we can find the numbers closest to ‘X’
     * through the following algorithm:
     *
     * Since the array is sorted, we can first find the number closest to ‘X’ through Binary Search.
     * Let’s say that number is ‘Y’.
     * The ‘K’ closest numbers to ‘Y’ will be adjacent to ‘Y’ in the array.
     * We can search in both directions of ‘Y’ to find the closest numbers.
     * We can use a heap to efficiently search for the closest numbers.
     * We will take ‘K’ numbers in both directions of ‘Y’ and push them in a Min Heap
     * sorted by their absolute difference from ‘X’. This will ensure that the numbers with
     * the smallest difference from ‘X’ (i.e., closest to ‘X’) can be extracted easily from the Min Heap.
     * Finally, we will extract the top ‘K’ numbers from the Min Heap to find the required numbers.

     * Alternate Solution using Two Pointers #
     * After finding the number closest to ‘X’ through Binary Search,
     * we can use the Two Pointers approach to find the ‘K’ closest numbers.
     * Let’s say the closest number is ‘Y’. We can have a left pointer to move back from ‘Y’
     * and a right pointer to move forward from ‘Y’.
     * At any stage, whichever number pointed out by the left or the right pointer gives
     * the smaller difference from ‘X’ will be added to our result list.
     *
     * To keep the resultant list sorted we can use a Queue. So whenever we take the number
     * pointed out by the left pointer, we will append it at the beginning of the list
     * and whenever we take the number pointed out by the right pointer we will append it at
     * the end of the list.
