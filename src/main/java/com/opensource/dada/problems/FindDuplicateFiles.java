/** Problem:
 * You left your computer unlocked and your friend decided to troll you
 * by copying a lot of your files to random spots all over your file system.
 *
 * Even worse, she saved the duplicate files with random,
 * embarrassing names ("this_is_like_a_digital_wedgie.txt" was clever, I'll give her that).
 *
 * Write a method that returns a list of all the duplicate files.
 * We'll check them by hand before actually deleting them,
 * since programmatically deleting files is really scary.
 * To help us confirm that two files are actually duplicates,
 * return a list of FilePaths objects with variables for the original and duplicate paths:
 *
 *   import java.nio.file.Path;
 *
 * public class FilePaths {
 *
 *     private Path duplicatePath;
 *     private Path originalPath;
 *
 *     public FilePaths(Path duplicatePath, Path originalPath) {
 *         this.duplicatePath = duplicatePath;
 *         this.originalPath  = originalPath;
 *     }
 *
 *     public Path getDuplicatePath() {
 *         return duplicatePath;
 *     }
 *
 *     public Path getOriginalPath() {
 *         return originalPath;
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public String toString() {
 *         return String.format("(duplicate: %s, original: %s)", duplicatePath, originalPath);
 *     }
 * }
 * Java
 * For example:
 *
 *   [(duplicate: /tmp/parker_is_dumb.mpg, original: /home/parker/secret_puppy_dance.mpg),
 * (duplicate: /home/trololol.mov, original: /etc/apache2/httpd.conf)]
 * You can assume each file was only duplicated once.
